#Introducing animation for the 2014 PNLD site of LEYA publisher

This animation was developed when Adobe Edge program was still beta.

It was something a lot of work because there was still no much documentation about the program but in the end everything went right.

It was also the first site that I developed using the concepts of responsive design.
